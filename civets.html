                Commonly called civet cats, civets are not cats. In fact, they are more closely related to mongooses than they are to cats. In Singapore, the Common Palm Civet is one of the species of civet that can be seen. Civets are commonly known as ‘Musang’ in the Malay Language.
                <br /><br />
                They are usually found living in the forests, parks, mangroves and even roof spaces of buildings in urban areas. They are nocturnal by nature and like to stay in trees and high places.
                <br /><br />
                In Singapore, they frequently eat the fruits of the Fishtail Palm and seed pods of the Rain Tree. Being omnivorous, they also like fruits such as mangoes, bananas and chikus and will eat small snakes, small birds, insects and rats.
                <br /><br />
                Did you know?<br />
                Coffee beans that have been eaten by civets and passed through their digestive system are highly valued in some neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia. This coffee goes by various names, including kopi luwak in Indonesia, kape alamid in the Philippines and weasel coffee in Vietnam. It is some of the most expensive coffee in the world, but can come at a cost to civets which are often poached from the wild and kept in inhumane conditions to produce the beans.

                What to do when you encounter a wild civet?

                    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
                        <li>1. Leave the civets alone- observe them from afar</li>
                        <li>2. Civets may eat leftover cat food that is left out in the open. If you do not want them to come to your property, please ensure that cat or dog food is kept indoors.</li>
                        <li>3. If you find baby civets in your property, leave them alone and do not attempt to pick them up. If people swarm around the baby civets, this prevents the mother from picking them up and the mother may end up abandoning them. If the mother is nearby, she will respond to their cries and attend to them.</li>
                        <li>4. If the civet happens to give birth in your property, leave it alone. The baby civets will start venturing out within two or three months after birth. After that, they will follow their mother to forage and will move out of your property eventually.</li>
